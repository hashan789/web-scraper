# web-scraper

Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.

Web scraping is integral to the process because it allows quick and efficient extraction of data in the form of news from different sources. Such data can then be processed in order to glean insights as required. As a result, it also makes it possible to keep track of the brand and reputation of a company.
